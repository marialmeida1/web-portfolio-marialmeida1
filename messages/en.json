I developed a full-stack mobile application designed to provide valuable content for women who are either interested in or already part of the field. <br/><br/> The app offers a variety of features: tech news, job opportunities, learning paths, and the promotion of initiatives and support communities. I also implemented a notification system to ensure users are always up to date with new messages and important updates. <br/><br/> The idea was born from a field study that sought to understand the impact of such projects on the journeys of women in the area. Based on the data collected, I began prototyping the screens and then moved on to technical implementation. For the back end, I used Laravel to build the API, while the front end was developed with Flutter. I also integrated Firebase Notifications and Laravel's Task Scheduler to ensure effective communication with users.",

The previously defined color palette was preserved to maintain the original identity, while the redesign focused on sophistication and repositioning the brand as an innovative and inclusive initiative that empowers women in technology.",

I also actively participated in building the back-end, implemented in Java with the Spark framework, and structuring the PostgreSQL database, ensuring full integration of the system.<br/><br/> Our team, composed of four members, was organized using the Scrum agile methodology, with sprints and daily meetings that enabled efficient collaboration, even with each member focusing on a specific area: front-end, back-end, database, and general leadership.<br/><br/> The project also included cloud computing concepts, using Azure for back-end hosting and implementing an intelligent system for user validation. For instance, it verified whether the CPF provided during registration matched the user's uploaded document.<br/><br/> The system was designed to connect student drivers and passengers, promoting safe and practical carpooling within the university.<br/><br/> As recognition, the project was selected among the best of the semester, earning second place in the university's public vote.",
